Resampling is important as it reduces variation of data ; data going into a model has to be uniform

T - transforms, to preform some data manipulation to make it suitable for training -> generate a model

functional -> layers, activations and more

Resamplig alters the frequency of one waveform to another

For batch and different waveforms processing > employ tranforms.Resample

T -> precomputes and caches the kernel used for resampling
